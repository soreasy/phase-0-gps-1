What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	- I was struggling with understanding how to ensure local branches are up to date with remote repo's and with understanding when it is safe to delete branches
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	- Both the above concepts were clarified during the GPS
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	- I/we asked the guide about why merging a local master branch to the remote master doesn't require a pull request and about how to comment on commits on Github. My pair and I asked each other about best practices for commit messages and together researched how to include inline images in MD files and how they are different from non-inline (reference) images 
What still confuses you about Git?
	- I'm still a little confused about whether or not it's possible to completely avoid merge conflicts. It seems like if a team of people are working on different features they might be at times unavoidable, in which case a human is needed to decide which code stays and which goes.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	- It was really great! I felt like my pair and I were very much on the same page and I really appreciated that we took our time and went step by step and made sure we understood everything we did, even if it meant not finishing the GPS in the hour. Our guide was also really helpful whenever we asked him for advice, and he knew when to step in and bring our attention to something we wouldn't otherwise have been aware of.
