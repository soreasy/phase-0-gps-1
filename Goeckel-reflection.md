#Alec Goeckel Reflection

###Questions
* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Before the GPS I was having trouble fully understanding how the Git merges work as well as the push and pull commands.


* What Concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I now have a better grasp on how branches are merged and how to prevent merge conflicts. Also I further understand how certain aspects of Github function such as adding contributors.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

One question that I had was regarding Github features. I was unaware that a developer could add comments to code and how to do so. Also I asked my pair if a git branch is removed once it is merged to the master branch or if you have to specifically use a command to delete it.

* What still confuses you about Git?

I'm still a bit confused about when to merge branches and how to revert to previous versions. I feel more confident on these topics than prior to this GPS, but it's still not fully clear.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS

I thought it was a bit uncomfortable having to navigate someone based upon my current understanding of programming, which isn't much so I didn't feel like I was knowledgeable enough to perform that task especially with a proficent programmer watching. However, it was a great experience and stretches me to step outside of my comfortzone while I am learning.
